# Plotting

This directory contains several scripts and tools related to the visualization
of the output of ZigZag. This is meant to make ZigZag more user-friendly.

To use the plotting functions of ZigZag :arrow_down_small:
 - Move inside this directory,
 - Call one of the appropriate scripts [plot_design_space](plot_design_space.py) or [plot_energy](plot_energy.py),

You may also modify the search path of those scripts, the files are very short, so this shouldn't be difficult. Alternatively, you may also write your own plotting scripts using the functions defined by the [reader class](reader.py). Examplesof using those functions are shown in an [example file](example.py).
